This repository contains a collection of Flutter projects focused on creating beautiful and responsive user interfaces, including web pages, login/signup screens, dashboards, and reusable UI components. The goal of this repository is to practice end-to-end Flutter development while learning how to structure applications, implement navigation, handle user input with form validation, and design layouts that adapt to both mobile and web platforms. Each project demonstrates clean code practices, use of widgets, and customization of themes to build modern, user-friendly applications. In addition to authentication flows such as login and signup, the projects also explore state management, routing, and integration with backend APIs to simulate real-world app functionality.
